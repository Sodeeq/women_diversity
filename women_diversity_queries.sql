/* The database contains data of employees from 1985 till date. For the sake of this analysis,
we are taking current year to be 2010.alter

Since the focus of this enquiry is on the current workforce, we will generate a dataset from the database,
that gives us the details about the current workforce, and from which further questions about the current
workforce could be answered*/
